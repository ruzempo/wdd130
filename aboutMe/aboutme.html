				<p>Hi everyone!</p>
				<p>My name is Rubén Zempoalteca and I live in México City. I have been a memeber of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day for almost 18 years. </p>
				<p>In this month I finished the PathwayConnect program and this is my first semester at BYU. Last august I finished my accountant degree and nowadays I work as a computer programmer. 
					I studied TI as a technical level and my goal is finish a BS in Applied Technology.</p>
				<p>I don't have much experience programming in front-end, so this course interests me a lot and I think it will help me to improve my web programming.</p>	
				<p>I love to cook with my wife, I like to make different salads and, of course, grilled meat can't be missed with family or friends on weekends.</p>
				<p>Best regards</p>
				<p>Rubén Zempoalteca.</p>
